## Storyline: Sleeping Beauty Version

### Overview: Lodgepole pine forests

- Once their were many mature lodgepole pine trees in the forests.

### Beetle Outbreak

- The populations of beetles that lived in the forest grew because they are able to survive the warmer winters and an abundance lodgepole pines trees for them to host on. They attacked more lodgepole pine trees then ever before, which killed much of the forest.

### Fuels

- The forest became a tinder box of standing dead trees that continued to hold their seeds and prevented the forest from regenerating.

### Wildfire

- Then wildfire came along and burned parts of the landscape of dead lodgepole pine. This released the seeds being held.

### Regeneration

- In many areas, lodgepole pine came back, but in some cases the combination of the dead trees from the beetle attack and fire killed the seeds and lodgepole did not return. 



## Storyline: Scientific/Academic Version

### Overview: Lodgepole pine forests

- Forest across central interior British Columbia are dominated by lodgepole pine. Forests are an integral part of the landscape and provide wildlife habitat, ecosystem services such as carbon storage, economic value in the form of timber harvest and recreation, and intrinsic value.
- Forest structure and life cycles are shaped by broad scale disturbances, most commonly mountain pine
  beetle outbreaks and wildfire. While lodgepole pine forests are accustom to large scale disturbance  events from mountain pine beetle outbreaks and wildfire, recent events have been unprecedented in magnitude and extent, which have created conditions in which these two disturbances overlap in time
  and space.
- Historically, beetle outbreaks have occur multiple times throughout the last century, while wildfire return is typically 100-150 year intervals for the region. Beetle outbreak and wildfire are integral to shaping forest structure, composition, and function. Lodgepole pine is a fire resilient species with a seedbank that it retains and releases after fire. 

### Beetle Outbreak

- Mountain pine beetles are a natural part of forest ecosystems in western North America. Lodgepole
  pine trees are the primary host for mountain pine beetles. Warmer winters and and abundance of
  mature lodgepole pine trees have created ideal conditions for the eruption in beetle populations
  that have resulted in millions of hectares of tree mortality. Much of the tree mortality has been
  concentrated in central interior British Columbia. 
- Female beetles find a suitable host tree and release a pheromone calling in other female beetles.
  They attack and overwhelm the tree. Under endemic conditions the tree is able to defend itself
  against the beetles, but during epidemics the tree's defense mechanisms become overwhelmed. When the tree becomes overwhelmed by beetles it is unable to acquire the water and nutrients it needs to survive leading to its death.
- Dead trees become snags and transition through post-mortem decay phases. During the green attack phase, trees retain their green needles, but their moisture content declines over the first year. The red phase follows and is characterized by red needles in the canopy, which last 1-3 years. Finally the tree transitions to the gray phase once the red needles are dropped.

### Fuels

- The post-mortem decay phase from beetle outbreak change the fuel structure in forests. The transition from live to dead forests results in fuels with lower moisture levels and is the largest change. The shift from live to dead also redistributes fuels. For example, needles and branches once held in the canopy are now located on the forest floor. Dead trees burn differently then live trees. Snags can burn longer due to extended periods of smoldering, which leads to increased biomass consumption.
- In the gray-phase, forests are composed of snags that lack canopy fuels and an abundance of snags.
  Snags can ignite at the base and flames can move up into the remaining branch structure. Flames that move into the branches can result in the ignition and combustion of cones. Ignition and
  combustion of cones is not typically a concern in the canopy of live trees as flames often move through canopies at a faster rate when the trees are alive. Burning of snags and consumption of cones may reduce the seedbank and impede regeneration.  

### Wildfire

- Wildfire occurs on the landscape when the conditions are beneficial for ignition and spread. These conditions often occur mid to late summer during drier, windier periods.
- Wildfire is a key disturbance mechanism in these forests that leads to rejuvenation, succession, and
  increased biodiversity. It creates an influx of nutrients and facilitates seed release for grasses,  herbaceous plants, shrubs, and lodgepole pine.
- This burn severity map shows a post fire mosaic for a fire that burned 2013. Large areas of high severity fire in red cover large portions of the mosaic

### Regeneration

- Regeneration is critical to forest recovery. The extent and magnitude of both beetle outbreak and wildfire creates variability in seed availability and regeneration response for lodgepole pine. The variability creates a diverse mosaic across the landscape that includes everything from high density dog-hair stands of lodgepole pine to areas of little to no tree regeneration. Much of the high severity burned area is dominated by herbaceous flowering plants and shrubs. Am increase in plant species diversity draws in species that may not be associated with old growth lodgepole pine forests.
- Postfire early successional habitat often attracts species like the black backed woodpecker that feeds on post fire insect activity. Hummingbirds enjoy the abundance of fireweed and other flowing plants. For some species, like Geranium bicknellii, postfire facilitates their germination after a century of dormancy
- Wildfire is a key mechanism for lodgepole pine regeneration. Lodgepole pine produce serotinous cones that retain seeds past maturity awaiting an environmental cue, in this case heat from fire, which melts the resinous bond and releases the seeds for germination. Fire also clears out the overstory for this sun loving species allowing them to be successful.
