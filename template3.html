                <h2>Overview: Lodgpole Pine Forests</h2>
                <h5>Once their were many mature lodgepole pine trees in the forests. </h5>
                <p>Forest across central interior British Columbia are dominated by Lodgepole pine. Forests
                    are an integral part of the landscape and provide wildlife habitat, ecosystem services such as
                    carbon storage, economic value in the form of timber harvest and recreation, and intrinsic value.
                </p>
                <p> Forest structure and life cycles are shaped by broad scale disturbances, most commonly mountain pine
                    beetle outbreaks and wildfire. While lodgepole pine forests are accustom to large scale disturbance
                    events from mountain pine beetle outbreaks and wildfire, recent events have been unprecedented in
                    magnitude and extent, which have created conditions in which these two disturbances overlap in time
                    and space.  </p>

                <p>Historically, beetle outbreaks have occur multiple times throughout the last century, while
                    wildfire return is typically 100-150 year intervals for the region. Beetle outbreak and wildfire
                    are integral to shaping forest structure, composition, and function. Lodgepole pine
                    is a fire resilient species with a seedbank that it retains and releases after fire.  </p>
            </section>

            <section data-scene="outbreak">
                <h2>Beetle Outbreak</h2>
                <h5>The populations of beetles that lived in the forest grew because they are able to survive the warmer
                    winters and an abundance lodgepole pines trees for them to host on. They attacked more lodgepole pine
                    trees then ever before, which killed much of the forest. </h5>
                <p>Mountain pine beetles are a natural part of forest ecosystems in western North America. Lodgepole
                    pine trees are the primary host for mountain pine beetles. Warmer winters and and abundance of
                    mature lodgepole pine trees have created ideal conditions for the eruption in beetle populations
                    that have resulted in millions of hectares of tree mortality. Much of the tree mortality has been
                    concentrated in central interior British Columbia.  </p>
                <p>Female beetles find a suitable host tree and release a pheromone calling in other female beetles.
                    They attack and overwhelm the tree. Under endemic conditions the tree is able to defend itself
                    against the beetles, but during epidemics the tree's defense mechanisms become overwhelmed. When the
                    tree becomes overwhelmed by beetles it is unable to acquire the water and nutrients it needs to
                    survive leading to its death. </p>
                <p>Dead trees become snags and transition through post-mortem decay phases. During the green
                    attack phase, trees retain their green needles, but their moisture content declines over the first
                    year. The red phase follows and is characterized by red needles in the canopy, which last 1-3 years.
                    Finally the tree transitions to the gray phase once the red needles are dropped.</p>
            </section>

            <section data-scene="fuels">
                <h2>Fuels for wildfire</h2>
                <h5>The forest became a tinder box of standing dead trees that continued to hold their seeds and
                    prevented the forest from regenerating.</h5>
                <p> The post-mortem decay phase from beetle outbreak change the fuel structure in forests. The
                    transition from live to dead forests results in fuels with lower moisture levels and is
                    the largest change. The shift from live to dead also redistributes fuels. For example, needles and
                    branches once held in the canopy are now located on the forest floor. Dead trees burn differently
                    then live trees. Snags can burn longer due to extended periods of smoldering, which leads to
                    increased biomass consumption.</p>
                <p>In the gray-phase, forests are composed of snags that lack canopy fuels and an abundance of snags.
                    Snags can ignite at the base and flames can move up into the remaining branch structure. Flames
                    that move into the branches can result in the ignition and combustion of cones. Ignition and
                    combustion of cones is not typically a concern in the canopy of live trees as flames
                    often move through canopies at a faster rate when the trees are alive. Burning of snags and
                    consumption of cones may reduce the seedbank and impede regeneration.   </p>
            </section>

            <section data-scene="wildfire">
                <h2>Wildfire</h2>
                <h5>Then wildfire came along and burned parts of the landscape of dead lodgepole pine. This released the seeds being held.</h5>
                <p> Wildfire occurs on the landscape when the conditions are beneficial for ignition and spread.
                    These conditions often occur mid to late summer during drier, windier periods. </p>
                <p>Wildfire is a key disturbance mechanism in these forests that leads to rejuvenation, succession, and
                    increased biodiversity. It creates
                    an influx of nutrients and facilitates seed release for grasses, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and
                    lodgepole pine. </p>
                <p>This burn severity map shows a post fire mosaic for a fire that burned 2013. Large areas of high
                    severity fire in red cover large portions of the mosaic.</p>

            <section data-scene="regeneration">
                <h2>Forest Regeneration</h2>
                <h5>In many areas, lodgepole pine came back, but in some cases the combination of the dead trees from the
                    beetle attack and fire killed the seeds and lodgepole did not return. </h5>
                <p>Regeneration is critical to forest recovery. The extent and magnitude of both beetle outbreak and
                    wildfire creates variability in seed availability and regeneration response for lodgepole pine.
                    The variability creates a diverse mosaic across the landscape that includes everything from high
                    density dog-hair stands of lodgepole pine to areas of little to no tree regeneration. Much of the
                    high severity burned area is dominated by herbaceous flowering plants and shrubs. Am increase in
                    plant species diversity draws in species that may not be associated with old growth lodgepole pine
                    forests. </p>
                <p>Postfire early successional habitat often attracts species like the black backed woodpecker that feeds
                    on post fire insect activity. Hummingbirds enjoy the abundance of fireweed and other flowing plants.
                    For some species, like Geranium bicknellii, postfire facilitates their germination after a century
                    of dormancy. </p>
                <p> Wildfire is a key mechanism for lodgepole pine regeneration. Lodgepole pine produce
                    serotinous cones that retain seeds past maturity awaiting an environmental cue, in this case heat
                    from fire, which melts the resinous bond and releases the seeds for germination. Fire also clears
                    out the overstory for this sun loving species allowing them to be successful.</p>

                        forests have been killed by mountain pine beetle outbreak and then burned during wildfire, which has raised
                        concerns and questions about fire severity and regeneration. This is demo for class lab:

                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
